# rapidapi-twitter-to-mysql

Adapter that pulls the amount of Twitter followers via RapidAPI and inserts it into a MySQL DB table. If you were wondering why the database has such a unfamiliar structure, that's because we blend the data with data from the Gravio IoT Database to show it all in one single Google Data Studio dashboard. Needless to say you can adapt the structure to whatever suits your needs.

You will need a RapidAPI account and authentication token for this. Get it from https://rapidapi.com/developer/dashboard , and you will need the "Twitter Followers" API from https://rapidapi.com/CrystalCrumble/api/twitter-followers/. You should get a few daily requests for free.

### Creating the database table

For this example, we created the a database using the below SQL, which is also used to store sensor data:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `gravio_data` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `AreaName` varchar(128) COLLATE latin1_general_ci NOT NULL,
  `LayerName` varchar(128) COLLATE latin1_general_ci NOT NULL,
  `DataKind` varchar(128) COLLATE latin1_general_ci NOT NULL,
  `PhysicalDeviceName` varchar(128) COLLATE latin1_general_ci NOT NULL,
  `PhysicalDeviceId` varchar(128) COLLATE latin1_general_ci NOT NULL,
  `DataId` varchar(128) COLLATE latin1_general_ci NOT NULL,
  `Timestamp` datetime NOT NULL COMMENT 'Original Sensor Timestamp',
  `Data` varchar(256) COLLATE latin1_general_ci NOT NULL,
  `created` timestamp NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP COMMENT 'MySQL Database Timestamp',
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
  KEY `id` (`id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB  DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1 COLLATE=latin1_general_ci AUTO_INCREMENT=8 ;
```

It's the same database as the [http post to mysql insert](https://github.com/cburgdorfer/http-post-to-mysql-insert)

Then we use a crontab to trigger the script 1x a day to pull the data and insert it into the database. This is then used to subsequently show the data in a Google Data Studio dashboard.
